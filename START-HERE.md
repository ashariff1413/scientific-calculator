# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Read This First!

## 🎯 You Need to Be IN the Project Folder!

### ❌ WRONG:
```
C:\Users\Abu>  git init
```
This initializes Git in your HOME folder (BAD!)

### ✅ CORRECT:
```
C:\Users\Abu\...\Scientific-Calculator-Clean>  git init
```
This initializes Git in your PROJECT folder (GOOD!)

---

## 🚀 Step-by-Step (Copy-Paste These)

### Step 1: Navigate to Project Folder
```bash
cd "C:\Users\Abu\OneDrive\Coding Projects\Kiro Projects\Java Calculator\Scientific-Calculator-Clean"
```

### Step 2: Verify You're in the Right Place
```bash
dir
```
You should see: `src`, `docs`, `scripts`, `README.md`

### Step 3: Initialize Git
```bash
git init
```
Should say: "Initialized empty Git repository in .../Scientific-Calculator-Clean/.git/"

### Step 4: Add Files
```bash
git add .
```

### Step 5: Commit
```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit - Scientific Calculator v1.0"
```

### Step 6: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `scientific-calculator`
3. Description: "Advanced scientific calculator"
4. Public or Private (your choice)
5. DON'T check "Initialize with README"
6. Click "Create repository"

### Step 7: Connect to GitHub
```bash
# Replace 'YOURUSERNAME' with your actual GitHub username!
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/scientific-calculator.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 📍 How to Check You're in the Right Folder

### In PowerShell/CMD:
```bash
# Show current directory
pwd

# Should show something like:
# C:\Users\Abu\OneDrive\Coding Projects\Kiro Projects\Java Calculator\Scientific-Calculator-Clean
```

### Visual Check:
Look at your terminal prompt. It should show:
```
...\Scientific-Calculator-Clean>
```

NOT:
```
C:\Users\Abu>
```

## ⚠️ What I Just Fixed

You ran `git init` in `C:\Users\Abu\` which would have:
- ❌ Tracked your entire user folder
- ❌ Tried to upload thousands of personal files
- ❌ Caused major problems

I deleted that `.git` folder for you. You're safe now!
